# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a command-line application that accepts a video file as input and uses Amazon Transcribe to generate a text transcription of the audio content. The application will be built in Rust and designed for simplicity, using default AWS credentials and outputting the transcription directly to the command line.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to pass a video file path and S3 bucket name as command line arguments, so that I can transcribe the audio content without manual file selection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user runs the application with a video file path and S3 bucket name arguments THEN the system SHALL accept both parameters
2. WHEN no file path or S3 bucket name is provided THEN the system SHALL display usage instructions and exit gracefully
3. WHEN an invalid file path is provided THEN the system SHALL display an error message and exit with non-zero status
4. WHEN an invalid or inaccessible S3 bucket name is provided THEN the system SHALL display an error message and exit with non-zero status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to automatically use my default AWS credentials, so that I don't need to configure authentication separately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL use default AWS credential chain (environment variables, AWS config files, IAM roles)
2. WHEN AWS credentials are not available THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message about missing credentials
3. WHEN AWS credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL display an authentication error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to upload my video file to the specified S3 bucket, so that the audio can be processed for transcription.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a valid video file is provided THEN the system SHALL upload the file to the specified S3 bucket for Transcribe processing
2. WHEN the file upload fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message with details
3. WHEN the video file format is unsupported THEN the system SHALL display a format error message
4. WHEN the S3 bucket does not exist or is not accessible THEN the system SHALL display a bucket access error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to initiate transcription using Amazon Transcribe, so that the audio content is converted to text.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the video file is uploaded THEN the system SHALL start a transcription job with Amazon Transcribe
2. WHEN the transcription job is submitted THEN the system SHALL poll for job completion status
3. WHEN the transcription job fails THEN the system SHALL display the failure reason

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the transcription results printed to the command line, so that I can immediately view the transcribed text.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the transcription job completes successfully THEN the system SHALL retrieve the transcription results
2. WHEN transcription results are retrieved THEN the system SHALL print the full text to stdout
3. WHEN the transcription is empty or unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating no transcription was generated

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to clean up temporary resources, so that I don't accumulate unnecessary files in AWS.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transcription processing is complete THEN the system SHALL delete the uploaded S3 file
2. WHEN the application encounters an error THEN the system SHALL attempt to clean up any created resources
3. WHEN cleanup fails THEN the system SHALL log a warning but not fail the main operation
