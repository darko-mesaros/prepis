# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a visual progress bar to indicate the upload progress when uploading video files to Amazon S3. The progress bar will provide real-time feedback to users about the upload status, showing percentage completion, upload speed, and estimated time remaining. This enhancement improves the user experience by providing transparency during potentially long upload operations for large video files.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user uploading a video file, I want to see a progress bar during the S3 upload, so that I know the upload is progressing and can estimate how long it will take.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file upload to S3 begins THEN the system SHALL display a progress bar showing 0% completion
2. WHEN the upload progresses THEN the system SHALL update the progress bar to reflect the current percentage of bytes uploaded
3. WHEN the upload completes THEN the system SHALL show 100% completion and hide the progress bar
4. WHEN the upload fails THEN the system SHALL clear the progress bar and display an error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user uploading a large video file, I want to see upload speed and time estimates, so that I can plan accordingly and know if the upload is performing well.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the upload is in progress THEN the system SHALL display the current upload speed in MB/s or KB/s
2. WHEN the upload is in progress THEN the system SHALL display an estimated time remaining based on current speed
3. WHEN the upload speed changes THEN the system SHALL update the time estimate accordingly
4. WHEN the upload completes in less than expected time THEN the system SHALL show the final completion message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the progress bar to be visually clear and not interfere with other output, so that I can easily understand the upload status without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the progress bar is displayed THEN it SHALL use a clear visual format with percentage, bar, and speed information
2. WHEN other log messages need to be displayed during upload THEN the system SHALL position them appropriately without corrupting the progress bar
3. WHEN the upload completes THEN the system SHALL clear the progress bar before showing the success message
4. IF the terminal doesn't support progress bars THEN the system SHALL fall back to periodic text updates

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the progress bar implementation to be robust and handle edge cases, so that the application doesn't crash or behave unexpectedly during uploads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the file size cannot be determined THEN the system SHALL display an indeterminate progress indicator
2. WHEN the upload is interrupted THEN the system SHALL clean up the progress bar display
3. WHEN multiple uploads happen sequentially THEN each SHALL have its own progress bar instance
4. WHEN the upload happens very quickly (small files) THEN the system SHALL still show progress feedback appropriately
