//! # S3 Operations
//!
//! This module handles all Amazon S3 operations for the Prepis application.
//!
//! It provides functionality for:
//! - Uploading files to S3 buckets
//! - Generating unique S3 keys for uploaded files
//! - Cleaning up temporary files after processing
//! - Error handling for S3 operations
//!
//! The module ensures that files are properly stored and cleaned up during
//! the transcription process.
